# Citizens Advice Challenge:
Create a ruby based application for a user registration and authentication system. It should be designed as a REST-ful API with JSON only responses, there is no need for views.

- Users need to be able to register with a username, email address and password (there is no need to send confirmation email).
- Users need to be able to authenticate with their username and password.
- When a user is successfully authenticated, the API needs to respond with a unique user token.
- Groups have a unique name and can have many users and users can belong to many groups.
- Some users have admin privileges and they need to be able to carry out the following actions using a valid user token:
    1. Create groups.
    2. Assign users to groups.

# Solution Approach:
 - Create Rails API using Ruby 3.2.0 and rails 7.0.4

 - Create an Authenticate API for users with using gem 'devise_token_auth'

 - For API Example, I can attach here one Postman Link to test

 - Create user with admin flag true or false therefore didnâ€™t go through with role based assignment in such case for different privileges, In solution we can use pudit either cancan to provide user to Authorization.

 - Groups have a unique name and can have many users and users can belong to many groups.in that case, I have used  NxN (many to many) relationships therefore model generate it like this: Group/User relationship using join table has_many :users, :through => :user_groups, For that I have only created methods to create groups and a method as assigned user in to group.

## Setup:
1.  Install ruby '3.2.0'
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `bundle install`
4. `rails db:setup`
5. `rails server`

## Tests:
- bundle exec rspec spec
